                                Living a life in a big city is damn too hectic where you meet new people almost everyday but you don't get peace of mind after meeting anyone.... So what can you do.. what can one do to get some attention some love back.... Guesses?? Correct.... Soft little padded foots and a lot more fur of a four legged puppy jumping to play with you can mean a world lot of happiness... I had few chances of my own to try the fun... And it's worth more than any normal entertainment... You get something here..

                                We had a super awesome time at Pawsters with Angel Muffin Koko and three other four legged friends. A unique concept, I believe first of its kind in Dharamshala. The place was comparable to some of the pet cafes I gave been to abroad. A peaceful quiet place despite being in the prime location of Dharamshala. The hosts were very hospitable and ensured that we had a good time. They have a small pool, we spent an hour relaxing and playing in it. Must visit for dog lovers!! They are soon opening their own cafe. We will be going back there pretty soon.
